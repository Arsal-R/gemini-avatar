*Daily Work Report - 26-April-2024*

Following is a list of tasks I did today,

* Started writing some code in js sample file for testing if it can understand and work like gpt 3 used to work with given prompts.
* Created a new prompt variable to be used as a conversation storing variable. 
* Created a whole prompt structure instructing the gpt that this is the whole conversation between user and gemini.
* Updated the prompt with adding more instructions to tell that gemini is an AI model and some more along with the instruction stating the gemini to look towards system prompt.
* Added a sample system prompt for testing the prompt. 
* Updated the code to use this system prompt to check the outcome to see if gemini was able to understand the system prompt and respond accordingly and it worked.
* Checked the running avatar chatbot version and found something that it could not remember the conversation with user.
* Started checking gemini if it is able to understand the conversation like in the same way as I used to do with gpt 3.
* I was not confirmed whether I could make that all testing mechanism in nodejs, so wrote the initial code again in python.
* Created a function named get_response which takes in the prompt and returns the response.
* Added a loop to allow the conversation keep on going to know if gemini is able to understand the user conversation and know respond with the previous question.
* After completing the code in python, tested it and after some attempts and further modifications, made it working.
* Updated the main route.js file to include the working code for the adding system prompt. The conversation history is not added as wasn't discussed and also time wasn't left.
